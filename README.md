#Â How Much is Enough?

[Visit the site](https://chryswoods.github.io/howmuchisenough)

This is a simple react web application that helps researchers compare the
amount of electricity used by their supercomputing jobs against the
amount of electricity consumed in their domestic lives. The aim is to
encourage researchers to consider the environmental impact of their
research, such that they take the time and effort to make their
supercomputing jobs as efficient as possible. This could be, e.g.
by ensuring that software and algorithms are optimised, jobs are run
using only the maximum necessary level of detail (i.e. not using
fine grids if they are not needed), running only the minimum necessary
number of repeats to statistically converge a result etc.

If you have any questions or want any information changed then please
